Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Banking Transactions

Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the detection of fraudulent activities in e-commerce and banking transactions using advanced machine learning techniques. Leveraging geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition, the goal is to develop robust models that minimize financial losses and enhance transaction security.

Business Need

As a data scientist at Adey Innovations Inc., I aimed to improve fraud detection for e-commerce transactions and bank credit transactions. This project represents a critical step towards creating reliable fraud detection systems that can operate in real-time and adapt to evolving fraudulent strategies.

Data

The project utilizes the following datasets:

1. Fraud_Data.csv: E-commerce transaction details (user_id, purchase_value, device_id, etc.).

2. IpAddress_to_Country.csv: Maps IP addresses to corresponding countries.

3. Creditcard.csv: Bank transaction data formatted for fraud detection (V1 to V28 features resulting from PCA).

Features

- Unique identifiers (user_id, device_id)

- Time-based features (signup and purchase timestamps)

- User demographics (age, gender)

- Purchase values and IP addresses

Methodology

1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing:

- Handling missing values and duplicates

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Geolocation analysis by merging datasets

1. Feature Engineering:

- Creation of derived features such as transaction frequency and time-based features.

1. Model Building and Training:

- Splitting data into training and testing sets and applying various machine learning algorithms.

Modeling Techniques

The following models were implemented and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression

- Decision Tree

- Random Forest

- Gradient Boosting

- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)

- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Model Explainability

Understanding model predictions is vital for trust and debugging. For this project, I applied:

- SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations): For overall feature importance.

- LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations): For individual predictions.

Deployment

The model is deployed using Flask for the API development, allowing real-time predictions and insights. An interactive dashboard using Dash was created to visualize fraud detection insights based on the models.

Technologies Used

- Python

- Pandas for data manipulation

- Scikit-learn for machine learning

- Flask for API development

- Dash for dashboard visualization

- Jupyter Notebook for analysis and experimentation

Future Enhancements

- Integrating real-time streaming data for live fraud detection.

- Implementing more sophisticated deep learning architectures for improved accuracy.

- Expanding the geolocation analysis for better insights.
